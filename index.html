								<h2>My Work Experience and Internships</h2>
								<p><ul>
									<li><h3>Analyst at ION trading | Current profile</h3>
									<p>ION trading provides software that allows major financial institutions to transact at the various marketplaces in the world. My role as an analyst in the Fixed Income department of the company is to handle the banks allocated to me and resolve any technical issues that they might face in their production/test environments. On a daily, I analyse interpret and resolve issues. I act as a link between the core development team and the client, and it is my duty to maintain the chain of communication</p></li>
									<li><h3>Business Analyst Intern | An online internship I am currently a part of | 2021</h3>
									<p>iNeuron has provided a virtual platform for internships where I take part in various projects related to business analytics and data science over the weekend. Currently, I am working on a project which aims to determine whether a new application will be successful on the google play store or not. The tools used in the project are Python, Excel and Powerbi.</p></li>
									<li><h3>The Chief Minister's Office | Web Development and Design | 2019</h3>
									<p>I interned at the Chief Minister’s Office of Delhi as a Front-end web and app developer. The project aimed at creating an app for local communities that would let them directly report any infrastructural or social issues in the app. The responsible authority would be alerted and would have to work on it, as the app would create a log base of all the complaints received. This project aimed at reducing corruption in the city as well as decentralising the power held with ministers and empowering the people. I wireframed, designed and developed a remote application for this project.</p></li>	
									<li><h3>Giesecke and Devrient | .Net Developer | 2018</h3>
									<p>I was a part of the company’s internal timesheet creation project. This was an application based on the C# .NET infrastructure which aimed to increase productivity of teams at the office. It allowed managers to see and optimize the time taken by each team member for projects</p></li>

							<p><ul>
								<li><h3>PowerBI Dashboard creation</h3>
								<p>I recently partook in a company side project that required me to analyze all sorts of customer data and create a customer satisfaction report on powerbi. The task was to first connect data from all the data sources using API's, excels etc. 
									I then had to narrow down on the factors that I wanted to represent, based on their importance and relevance to the higher management. This report helped the senior management of my company gauge the satisfaction of our customer and helped pipoint areas where our teams needed to improve.
									Since the report contains confidential data, I am unable to provide an image of the same. I will be updating this page with more dashboards as and when they are publicly available.
								</p></li>
								<li><h3>Reseach paper on applying Deep Learning on small tabular datasets</h3>
								<p>Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning inspired by the human brain. It uses multiple layers of representation to extract specific knowledge from raw input. It is best suited for large image or sound-based datasets. Deep learning methods are generally avoided for small datasets because they tend to overfit. 
									Transfer learning can be one approach used to solve this problem. However, in the case of tabular datasets, their heterogeneous nature makes transfer learning algorithms inapplicable. This paper aims to discuss a few approaches using a literature review to convert tabular data into images to overcome such limitations. The paper provides a 2-part study wherein we first give a brief overview of transfer learning enhancing the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and drastically reducing the training time for small datasets. Secondly, we provide a detailed study of different techniques available to convert tabular data into images for image classification such as SuperTML, IGTD, and REFINED approach. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach inspired by IGTD to create a blocked image representation of the tabular data on which we apply transfer learning to demonstrate the application of deep learning methods on small tabular datasets (with less than 1000 data points).</p>This research paper got presented at the AIST'21 conference and was selected to be published  in the Springer Journal. I will update this page with the link as soon as it gets published. <p></p></li>
								<li><h3>Web Scraper in python using the BeautifulSoup library</h3>
								<p>During the third year of my undegarduate degree, I wanted to find healthy vegetarian recipes which could help me become fit. However, I found searching the web to be a tedious process. There were a lot of advertisements and the measurements of the raw ingredients were not always uniform. This is when I took to python and tried my hand at webscraping using the BeautifulSoup Library. The BeautifulSoup library allowed me to scrape and store multiple recipes, which I would randomize and try to make at home. This was a very fun project and created a real impact in my way of living. </p></li>	
								<li><h3>Front-end Web Development and UI/UX Design</h3>
								<p>During my time as the Graphic Design Mentor at the GDSC chapter of my college, I was tasked with designing a website for all interested students on the campus. Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are community groups for college and university students interested in Google developer technologies.
								While making this website, I involved the students I was mentoring to give them exposure to a real life project. The <a href="https://gdscmait.co/#/">website </a> has now been updated and is maintained by the new students in the GDSC, however it provided a great learning experience for me and my fellow undergraduate students. We explored and learned ReactJS to make the front end of the website. This instilled confidence in me and allowed me to work as a freelance designer.
								Some of my noteworthy contributions were: The Mohalla Sabha project - Internship at the Chief Minister's Office and the Organ Donation Portal - Made during a hackathon
								</p></li>
								<l1><h3>Analysis of spinal abnormalities using supervised learning algorithms - Minor Project | undergraduate degree.</h3>
								<p>In this paper we aim to use various supervised learning algorithms and previous works such as decision trees, random forest, SVM and KNN to determine the most suitable algorithm for classification of spinal abnormalities. A support vector machine (SVM) is machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression.</p>
								<p>The paper also gives an overview of the KNN algorithms which is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. A comparison with several supervised learning algorithms is performed. We conclude by showing that the use KNN and SVM with RBF Kernel has provided most desirable result and the paper also presents recently proposed algorithm SPTWSVM as the future scope for classification of spinal abnormalities. 
								</p></l1>
								<li><h3>Sustainaible Business Development</h3>
								<p>I was among the few selected for the Young India Challenge which aimed to challenge the students from all over the country to develop sustainable business ideas that help reduce waste and are in accordance with the UN guidelines. These business ideas were then pitched to possible investors.
								In this project, I developed a solution which revolved around repurposing sawdust ,generated at various independent furniture shops, to make new furniture. This idea would've helped improve the air quality, reduced the pollution and also created jobs for many people. This project was also shown to be economically viable and was really appreciated at the conference. </p></li>
								<li><h3> Other projects I have created:</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Timesheet to track employee hours - Giesecke and Devrient Internship</li>
									<li>IOT Project: Estimation of Soil conditions to report to farmers for correct use to increase yield.</li>									</li>
								</ol></li>
								<li><h3>Work in progress:</h3>
								<ul>
								<li> List tracker - An application to keep track of all the things you take when moving elsewhere/ travelling.</li>
								<li> A remote alarm clock - For your friends to be able to wake you up, so you are not late anywhere. Can also work as a phone locator</li>

							<p>I have always felt that we are who we are because of the people around us. I still believe in humanity and to that end,I have tried to do my bit for the society through my music and theatre. </p>

							<p>Linked below are some street-plays that have been performed by me and my team. As the name suggests, these plays happen on the local streets of our cities and try to spread awareness about sensitive issue in the country </p>
							<ul><li><h3>De Taali</h3>
							De Taali was a play that addressed the unjust stigmatization of transgenders and the discrimination against them. Through this play we tried to spread awareness about the LGBTQ+ community, especially the transgender community. We performed this play in various localities across delhi. The play was loved by many, especially the hijra community and was also appreciated at the national level.The video below is a recording of one of our performances. The play was scripted in hindi, so a larger audience could be reached.</li>

							<li><h3>The Placement Cell</h3>
							<p>The placement cell was a play that tackled the human trafficking that still exists today. We spoke against a crime that isn't obvious to us unless we really think about it. The play highlighted various points and tried to make to viewer realise that whatever product/facility they are availing today, might be made by a modern day slave. To take the first step towards ending this inhumane crime we urged the audience to be more attentive to their surroundings. The play was highly appreciated across the Delhi Collegiate Theatre Circuit and was given various awards.</p></li>
